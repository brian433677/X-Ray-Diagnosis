**X-Ray Medical Diagnosis with Deep Learning**


This project is based on medical image diagnosis by building a chest X-ray classifier using Keras.

The purpose of this project is to utilize convolutional neural networks for visual recognition to help radiologists in identifying masses in chest.
 
The workflow of the project is as follow:

-Data preparation through visualizing data and preventing data leakage

-Model development through addressing class imbalance and leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning

-Evaluation using AUC and ROC curves
