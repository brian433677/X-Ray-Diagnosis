# Medical Diagnosis Project


This project is based on medical image diagnosis by building a chest X-ray classifier using Keras
 
The workflow of the project is as follow:

-Data preparation through visualizing data and preventing data leakage

-Model development through addressing class imbalance and leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning

-Evaluation using AUC and ROC curves
