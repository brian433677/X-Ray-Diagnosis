# Medical Diagnosis Project


This project is based on medical image diagnosis by building a chest X-ray classifier using Keras
 
The workflow of the project is as follow:

-Data preparation through Visualizing data and Preventing data leakage

-Model Development through Addressing class imbalance and Leveraging pre-trained models using transfer learning

-Evaluation using AUC and ROC curves
